# Memory Game

This is a small memory game made with C++. The ideia of the game is to combine pairs of the same number.
For this version, there is only 8 pairs to be done for you to win the game.

To select a position on the Array, you'll be prompted the line and the collumn, each on it's individual prompt. Them this will be repeated for the second number.

If you get the numbers correct, you recevie a "Jogada OK" alert, else a "Jogada NOK". Once the number is correct, it will be visible through the rest of the game.

PS: You will not be able to select values outside the Array, or values that have already been discovered (when you recevie the "Jogada OK"), but you will not lose any round if you happen to select it.

You lose the game if you cannot discover the pairs in the ammount of round shown of the top of the screen. It will show your current round and the total rounds you can play.
